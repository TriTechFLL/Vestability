# Vestability
#Vestability is an open source!

There are a few simple steps to get Vestability up and running!
First, follow these three steps.

After these steps, 3d prints the case with the provided model files "Pi 5 Top and Pi 5 Bottom." Then, place the pi in the m and snap the two halves together.

Once all of the previous steps are done and you get the parts from this list

2. Audio amp https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DKAI51M?starsLeft=1&ref_=cm_sw_r_cso_sms_apan_dp_EQYGEG4X4VXNSC636E36 
3. Haptic https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071J49QPF?starsLeft=1&ref_=cm_sw_r_cso_sms_apan_dp_B3DA6WHQNWPSG7QKZ1VE
4. Sense Hat [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014HDG74S?starsLeft=1&ref_=cm_sw_r_apan_dp_4V39R0SR6THX6CBN097B](https://a.co/d/15sbRLu)
Then on to haptic wiring
Just solder two wires to the haptic module (polarity does not matter at all)
Then, connect them to the L or R channel of the audio amplifier (again, it is inconsequential which one you decide on)
After this step, you must install all of the required software components. This is accomplished in the command line built into 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS
apt install easy effects
(instructions coming soon for more prerequisites)

Once this is finished installing, you need to tune the haptics or install our preset for amplification of drums and symbols and other essential rhythm indicators in songs (coming soon)

Then you need to set up the autorun at the start (WIP)
